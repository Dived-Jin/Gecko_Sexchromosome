# 05.Sex_evolution
This folder includes the pipelines used to estimate male mutation bias & sex divergence time.

The abbreviations in the document are represented the species name, which is found in [species.txt](https://github.com/Dived-Jin/Gecko_Sexchromosome/blob/af3026331796bd45a6fcf1bb4dc1415eb5a400ed/species.txt).

## (1)a.Sexchromsome_alignment_merge.sh
The case that the sex chromosome aligned to other homologues in other species.
```
used: sh a.Sexchromsome_alignment_merge.sh
    - example/*.txt: the sex chromosome list and the homologues list in other species.
```

## (2)b.Mergemaf_filter.sh
Removed the repeat and cds region from maf file,the input dir structure and file name are the same as example example/maffilter.

## (3)c.male_mutation_bias.sh
Calculated the male mutation bias.

## (4)d.scale_sexdivergencetime.sh
Scaled the sex divergence time
```
used: sh d.scale_sexdivergencetime.sh
    - Mafdir: maf path is generated by b.Mergemaf_filter.sh
    - SDRpath: SDR region file with bed format.
```

## (5) e.SDR_gene_classification
This directory is an example case to categorize genes on SDR into ancestral, gain and unknown
