This folder include two pipline that help us to get alignment and integrate multi-species alignment results:
(1) a.LAST_alignment.sh: the script is used to get whole genome or chromosome alignment and generate the NET and MAF file.
    used : sh a.LAST_alignment.sh <genome1.fa> <genome2.fa>
    - genome1.fa: fasta file of target species or chromosome. The repeat sequences had been masked.
    - genome2.fa: fasta file of query species or chromosome. The repeat sequences had been masked.
    for example: 
        a. whole genome alignment: sh a.LAST_alignment.sh correlophus_sarasinorum.ZW.fasta correlophus_ciliatus.ZW.fasta
        b. sex chromosome alignment: sh a.LAST_alignment.sh correlophus_sarasinorum.chrZ.fasta correlophus_sarasinorum.chrW.fasta
        The major file include: 
        - query.net & target.net the alignment file with NET format.
        - out.Net2maf.add.maf the alignment file with MAF format.
        - target.net.filt.aln and out.Net2maf.add.maf.aln :  The NET and MAF file transformed to alignment txt file with eigth columns: target_scaffold_id, chain, target_start_site, target_end_site, query_scaffold_id, chain, query_start_site, query_end_site, such as example/target.net.filt.aln, example/out.Net2maf.add.maf.aln

(2) MAF file merge: b.LAST_multiz.sh
    used: sh b.LAST_multiz.sh <maf1list> <Refspecies> <merge_stepfile>
        - maf1list: the text file with three columns: species_full_name, species_abbreviation, mafpath
            for example:  pygopus_nigriceps.XY  PYGNIG maf1
                          correlophus_ciliatus.ZW CORCIL maf2
            the MAF files were generated by a.LAST_alignment.sh  
            the example file of maf1list example/Maflis.txt
        - merge_stepfile: the text file with four columns: maf1_path, path2_path, outmaf_name, commandline_file; such as example/merge_step.txt 
    In our work, used this script as:
        sh b.LAST_multiz.sh example/mafpath.txt CORSAR example/merge_step.txt
