This pipline is used to identify sex chromosome by following two methods:
(1) a.depth_method.sh: the script is used to identify sex chromosome  by male and female depth 
    used : sh a.depth_method.sh  <genome> <sex type> <male_fq1> <male_fq2> <female_fq1> <female_fq2>
        - genome : genome file with fasta format.
        - sex type: sex determinate system : XY or ZW 
        - male_fq1, male_fq2: Genome Resequence data with fastq formate of male.
        - female_fq1,female_fq2 : Genome Resequence data with fastq formate of female.
    In our work, used this script as:
        sh a.depth_method.sh correlophus_sarasinorum.ZW.fasta ZW male_1.fq.gz male_2.fq.gz female_1.fq.gz female_2.fq.gz
        The major file include:
        - FMmerge.50k.cov.ratio.class: The cluster result file include all scaffold. such as example/FMmerge.50k.cov.ratio.class
          it's means that the whole scaffold is clustered to XZ or YW or autosome (A) if a line begins with > , include eight columns: scaffild id, scaffold length, XZ length ,ratio, YW length, ratio, A length , ratio, cluster result. 
          it's means that the special region is clustered to XZ or YW or autosome (A) if a line don't begins with >, include fifteen columns: scaffild id , start site, end site, male sequence depth (medain), male sequence depth (mean), male sequence coverage, female sequence depth (medain), female sequence depth (mean), female sequence coverage, normalized male depth (nmdep), normalized female depth(nfdep), nfdep/nmdep or nmdep/nfdep, male coverage ratio, female  coverage ratio.
        - *.pdf : the figure of depth. such as example/chrZ.txt.norm.pdf
        - PAR.bed and nonPAR.bed: sex chromsome region with bed format. such as example/nonPARW.bed, example/nonPARZ.bed, example/PAR.bed

(2) b.Fst_method.sh: the script is used to identify sex chromosome by Fst.
    used : sh b.Fst_method.sh <genome> <special_chr> <sample.list>
        - genome : genome file with fasta format.
        - special_chr : the id of candidate.
        - sample.list : the list file of genome resequence data, with three columns (sample id , fastq1 and fastq2 ), the format same with example/sample.list
    In our work, used this script as:
        such as: sh b.Fst_method.sh thecadactylus_rapicauda.ZW.fasta chr1 sample.list
    
(3) c.filter_smallscaffold.sh: the script is used to filter the false positive from Fst or depth methods result bese on compared the interaction strength between samll scaffold and sex chromosome or autosome.
    used: sh c.filter_smallscaffold.sh <larger_sex_chromsomid_list> <Auotosme_id_list> <small_scaffold_list> <HiC_strength_maxtir> <HiC_windows_bed> <out_file>
        - larger_sex_chromsomid_list : sex chromosome list with bed format. such as example/Sextrue.bed
        - Auotosme_id_list: autosome list list with bed format. such as example/Autotrue.bed
        - small_scaffold_list: small scaffold list with bed format. such as example/unconfirm.bed
        - HiC_strength_maxtir: The interaction strength matrix is generated by others/HiC_strength_calculate.sh. The file include three columns: winds_id 1, winds_id 2, interaction strength. such as example/aristelliger_praesignis.ZW.bsorted.pairs.gz.100kb.cool.KR.hicpro 
        - HiC_windows_bed : This windows id which were used to calculate the interaction strength.  The file include four columns: scaffold id , start site, end site, winds_id. such as example/aristelliger_praesignis.ZW.hicpro.100kb.bed. 
        - out_file : output file. This file include eight columns: scaffold id , max interaction strength with sex, interaction strength, max interaction strength with autosome. interaction strength, random sum test p-value, sex_strength/autosome_strength, raw aomfirmed. example/SmallSex.100kb.strength.bed
    In our work, used this script as:
        used: sh  c.filter_smallscaffold.sh Sextrue.bed Autotrue.bed unconfirm.bed aristelliger_praesignis.ZW.bsorted.pairs.gz.100kb.cool.KR.hicpro aristelliger_praesignis.ZW.hicpro.100kb.bed  SmallSex.100kb.strength.bed
