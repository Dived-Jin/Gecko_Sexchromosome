This folder include the piplines that are used to construct species phylogeny.
(1) a.get_alignment.sh: extracted the alignment from mafile.
    used: sh a.get_alignment.sh <inputmafpath> <refaifile>
        inputmafpath: the MAF file which had been generated by 02.AlignmentLAST 
        format: maf1path
                maf2path 
        refaifile: reference geneome fai file
    output file:
        a. remove gap file with fasta file 
        b. kept alignment region list; such as example/Seed.list.
        c. alignment file with PHY format.

(2) b.phylogeny.sh: constructed phylogeny used iqtree2, and integrated the tree by Astral.
    - such as example/Seed.list.
    - AlignmentPath ,the path of alignment region with PHY format.
    used: sh b.phylogeny.sh
    output file:
        - tree.list.tree: the tree list which is generated by iqtree2.
        - Gekko_24_finaltopology.nwk: the result of phylogeny with NWK.
        
(3) c.divergence.sh: estimated the divergence time by mcmctree
    used: sh c.divergence.sh
    - Ungapfasta: then alignemt file with fasta format which remove alignment gap.
    - treefile: tree file with NWK file which was generated from b.phylogeny.sh.

(4) d.discovista.sh: calculated the frequence of three topology of each node.
    used: sh d.discovista.sh 
    - tree.list.tree: the tree list which is generated by iqtree2.
    - Gekko_24_finaltopology.nwk: the result of phylogeny with NWK.

(5) e.Quible.sh: The ILS and introgression were estimated by Quible.
    used: sh e.Quible.sh <Seedlist> <Treelist> <phylogeny>
    - Seedlist:  kept alignment region list; such as example/Seed.list.
    - Treelist:  the tree list which is generated by iqtree2. example/tree.list.tree
    - phylogeny:  the result of phylogeny with NWK. Such as example/Gekko_24_finaltopology.nwk
    raw input:
    - sampleInputFile.txt: the contral file of quible.
    In our work, used this script as:
        sh e.Quible.sh example/Seed.list. example/tree.list.tree example/Gekko_24_finaltopology.nwk
